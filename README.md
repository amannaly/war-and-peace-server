# War & Peace Server
>WIP: an asynchronous web server built using netty. 

Working on building an asynchronous high performance web server capable of handling tens of thousands of 
concurrent connections with latency less than 10 milliseconds. 


The web server searches though Leo Tolstoy's War & Peace and returns all the lines in the novel containing the 
word provided as a query parameter.
